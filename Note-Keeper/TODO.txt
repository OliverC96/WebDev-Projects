Features currently in development:
-> Implement authentication (local and 3rd party) via passport.js
    * Currently facing significant issues with axios/react/node navigation
-> Display personalized welcome message/greeting in navbar when user is logged in
-> Display logout link in navbar only when user is logged in
    -> I.e. conditionally render the logout link/icon based on user's current authentication status
